Objective : The goal of this assignment is to use the Fashion MNIST dataset that is available in Keras to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. You will build the model, make visualizations, and assess how well it performs on training and validation data. Lastly, make predictions using the test data using the trained model.
